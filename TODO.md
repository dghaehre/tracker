# Tracker

## MVP

Goal: get something useable out the door. Might not look pretty, but I want to be able to use it.

- [ ] User specified action

### Allow for "tracking" a user specified action.

- [X] Create sql table for action
- [ ] Create page/form for adding an action
- [ ] Create page for viewing actions
  - [ ] Allow for deleting an action
  - [ ] Allow for editing an action
- [ ] Create page/form for "tracking" an action
  - This means having a form on the "frontpage" for a logged in user to very easily record their daily actions.

We then want to somehow be able to tie that to any user specified competition...


### Great design
