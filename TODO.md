# Tracker

## MVP

Goal: get something useable out the door. Might not look pretty, but I want to be able to use it.

- [ ] User specified action
- [ ] Tie an action with a competition

### Allow for "tracking" a user specified action.

Setup action:

- [X] Create sql table for action
- [X] Create a page for creating a new action
- [X] Create post endpoint to handle action creation
- [ ] Create page for editing an action
- [ ] create endpoint for deletion of action

Tracking:

- [ ] Create sql table to "track" actions (record?)
- [ ] Endpoint to allow for "tracking" action
- [ ] A form on user homepage for "tracking" an action. Should be very easy to record!
- [ ] Add link to edit action page on user homepage

### Tie an action with a competition

- [ ] Update sql tables to allow for linking an action with a competition.
  - Any competition? invites?


### Great design
